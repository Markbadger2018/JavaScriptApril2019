/*
Challenge 1:
Write a function that accepts two names as parameters and then prints the full name to the console.

Example: greeting('Robin', 'Holler')
*/

function name1(first, last){
    let fullName = `${first} ${last}`;
    console.log(`Hello my name is ${fullName}`);
}

/*
Challenge 2:
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100.
For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print 'Fizz'.
For multiples of 5, instead of the number, print 'Buzz'.
For multiples of 3 AND 5, instead of the number, print 'Fizz Buzz'.
*/

let (0 = x, x <= 100, x++)


/*
Challenge 3:
Write a function called isRightTriangle that accepts three parameters called: side, base, and hypotenuse.
The function should return true if it forms a right triangle; it should return false if it doesn't.
(HINT: pythagorean theorem: a**2 + b**2 = c**2).

Example: 
isRightTriangle(3,4,5) == true
isRightTriangle(5,6,7) == false
*/

/*
Challenge 4:
Create an object literal called netflix.
It will have three properties: id, name, and seasonInfo.
Id will be an integer and name will be a string.
SeasonInfo will be an object which will have a property called episodeInfo, which is an array of more objects.
Those objects have an episode number property and an episodeName property.

You are welcome to fabricate the data.
